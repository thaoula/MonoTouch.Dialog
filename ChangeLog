	* Changed the DVC constructors so that they save the passed in UITableViewStyle. Previously, the style passed to the constructor was passed along to the based
	UITableViewController and not saved. Since the UITableView was actually created in the loadView function and the Style field was not updated you always got a Grouped 	UITableView which is cool until you want a plain one.

	* Add the following properties / methods to Element. 

	- CssClass: This property is used to specify the name of a Style sheet class you wish to use to style an element.
	- InheritStyle: This property is a flag that allows elements to block Style inheritance.
	- InheritedStyle: This property returns an ElementStyle object with the styles inherited all the way up the Element tree.
	- ElementStyle: This property return the ElementStyle from the stylesheet.
	- ApplyStyle: This method should be called in GetCell to apply any inherited styles.

	- Add ApplyStyle to all GetCell functions.

	* Created the ElementStyle class that represents a style.
	* Create the StyleSheet class as a container for all the styles. The Default property returns a static instance that be be used throughout the application.

	If the style concept is accepted then many of the style related derivatives of several elements could be marked as Depricated.
